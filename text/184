"I shant speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff!" an-
swered Catherine. "Papa says you are a
wicked man, and you hate both him and me;
and Ellen says the same."

"That is nothing to the purpose," said
Heathcliff. (He it was.) "I don't hate my
son, I suppose, and it is concerning him, that I
demand your attention. Yes! you have cause
to blush. Two or three months since, were
you not in the habit of writing to Linton?
making love in play, eh? You deserved, both
of you, flogging for that! You especially, the
elder, and less sensitive, as it turns out. I've
got your letters, and if' you give me any pert-
ness, I'll send_them to your father. I presume
you grew weary of the amusement, and
dropped it, didn't you? Well, you dropped
Linton with it, into a Slough of Despond. He
was in earnest--in love--really. As true as I
live, he's dying for you--breaking his heart at
your fickleness, not figuratively, but actually.
Though Hareton has made him a standing jest
