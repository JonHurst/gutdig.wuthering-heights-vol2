and fears, and anxious wishes for her son, and
her commendations of him to his care, he
grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding
him up, and searched in his heart how it might
be avoided. No plan offered itself: the very
exhibition of any desire to keep him would
have rendered the claimant more peremptory:
there was nothing left but to resign him.
However, he was not going to rouse him from
his sleep.

"Tell Mr. Heathcliff," he answered, calmly,
"that his son shall come to Wuthering
Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too
tired to go the distance now. You may also
tell him that the mother of Linton desired him
to remain under my guardianship; and, at
present, his health is very precarious."

"Noa!" said Joseph, giving a thud with
his prop on the floor, and assuming an authori-
tative air. "Noa! that manes nowt--Hathe-
cliff maks noa 'cahnt uh t' mother, nur yah
norther--bud he'll hev his lad; und Aw mun
tak him--soa nah yah knaw!"
