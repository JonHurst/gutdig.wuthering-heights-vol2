I felt stunned ‘l1;the awful event; and my
memory unavoidably recurred to former times
with a sort of oppressive sadness. But poor
Hareton the most wronged, was the only one
that really suffered much. He sat by the
corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.
He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic,
savage face that every one else shrank from
contemplating; and bemoaned him with that
strong grief which springs naturally from a
generous heart, though it be tough as tempered
steel.

Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what
disorder the master died. I concealed the
fact of his having swallowed nothing for four
days, fearing it might lead to trouble, and
then, I am persuaded he did not abstain on
purpose; it was the consequence of his strange

illness, not the cause.
