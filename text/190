182 WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

CHAPTER IX.

THE rainy night had ushered in a niisty morn-
ing—half frost, half drizzle—and temporary
brooks crossed our path, gurgling from the up-
lands. My feet were thoroughly Wetted; I
was cross and low, exactly the humour suited
for making the most of these disagreeable
things.

VVe entered the farm-house by the kitchen
way to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were
really absent ; because I put slight faith in his

own aﬂirmation.
