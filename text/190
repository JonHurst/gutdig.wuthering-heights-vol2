CHAPTER IX.

THE rainy night had ushered in a misty morn-
ing--half frost, half drizzle--and temporary
brooks crossed our path, gurgling from the up-
lands. My feet were thoroughly wetted; I
was cross and low, exactly the humour suited
for making the most of these disagreeable
things.

We entered the farm-house by the kitchen
way to ascertain whether Mr. Heathcliff were
really absent; because I put slight faith in his
own affirmation.
