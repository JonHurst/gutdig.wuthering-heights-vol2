WUTHERING HEIGHTS. 93

“ He’s not, he’s not my cousin, Ellen 1” she
went on, gathering fresh grief from reﬂection,
and ﬂinging herself into my arms for refuge
from the idea.

I was much vexed at her and the servant
for their mutual revelations; having no doubt
of Linton’s approaching arrival, communicated
by the former, being reported to Mr. Heath-
cliff; and feeling as conﬁdent that C'atherine’s
first thought on her father’s return, would be
to_ seek an explanation of the latter’s assertion,
concerning her rude-bred kindred.

Hareton, recovering from his disgust at
being taken for a servant, seemed moved by
her distress; and, having fetched the pony
round ‘to the door, he took, to propitiate her,
a ﬁne crooked-legged terrier whelp from the
kennel ;'and putting it into her hand, bid her
wisht for he meant naught.

Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed
him with a glance of awe, and horror, then

burst forth anew.
