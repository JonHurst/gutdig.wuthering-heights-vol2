tion of her threat directly, but Linton was up
in alarm, for his dear self, again. He clasped
her in his two feeble arms, sobbing-

"Won't you have me, and save me--not let
me come to the Grange? Oh! darling Cathe-
rine! you mustn't go, and leave me, after all.
You must obey my father, you must!"

"I must obey my own," she replied, "and
relieve him from this cruel suspense. The
whole night! What would he think? he'll
be distressed already. I'll either break or
burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!
You're in no danger--but, if you hinder me
--Linton, I love papa better than you!"

The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's
anger, restored to the boy his coward's elo-
quence. Catherine was near distraught--still,
she persisted that she must go home, and tried
entreaty, in her turn, persuading him to sub-
due his selfish agony.

While they were thus occupied, our jailer
re-entered.
