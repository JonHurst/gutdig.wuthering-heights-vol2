“ Hareton is it you he’;-3 ﬁnding fault With ?”

“Iv’e pulled up two or three bushes,” re-
plied the young man,“ but I’m going to set
’em again.

“ And why have you pulled them up?” said
the master.

Catherine wisely put in her tongue.

“ ‘We wanted to plant some ﬂowers there,”
she cried. “I’m the only person to blame, for
I wished him to do it.”

“ And who the devil gave you leave to touch
a stick about the place ?” demanded her father-
in-law, much surprised. “ And who ordered
you to obey her?” he added turning to Hare-
ton.

The latter was speechless; his cousin replied-—

“You shouldn’t grudge a few yards of

earth, for me to ornament, when you have

taken all my land !”
“Your land, insolent slut? you never had
any!” said Heathcliff.
