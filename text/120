his father sent for him suddenly, and he has
been obliged to leave us."

Linton was very reluctant to be roused
from his bed, at five o'clock, and astonished
to be informed that he must prepare for fur-
ther travelling: but I softened off the matter
by stating that he was going to spend some
time with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who
wished to see him so much, he did not like to
defer the pleasure till he should recover from
his late journey.

"My father?" he cried, in strange perplex-
ity. "Mamma never told me I had a father.
"There does he live? I'd rather stay with
uncle."

"He lives a little distance from the
Grange," I replied, "just beyond those bills-
not so far, but you may Walk over here, when
you get hearty. And you should be glad to
go home, and to see him. You must try to
love him, as you did your mother, and then he
will love you."
