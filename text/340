attempt at enlightening the darkness in which
he had been reared, I observed,

in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has selected
my favourite pieces that I love the most to re-
peat, as if out of deliberate malice!"

Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute;
he laboured under a severe sense of mortifica-
tion and wrath, which it was no easy task to
suppress.
