tempered bit of a sickly slip that ever strug-
gled into its teens! Happily, as Mr. Heath-
cliff conjectured, he'll not win twenty! I
doubt whether he'll see spring indeed--and

a protracted pause of meditation, "and he
ought to live the longest, he will--he must
live as long as I do. He's as strong now as

tive of that! It's only a cold that ails him,
the same as papa has--You say papa will get
better, and why shouldn't he?"
