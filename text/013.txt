wnrnnmxc HEIGHTS. 5

Gimmerton chapel hells were still ringing;
and the full, mellow flow of the beck in the
valley, came soothingly on the ear. It was a
sweet substitute for the yet‘ absent murmur of
the summer foliage which drowned that music
about the Grange, when the trees were in leaf.
At \Vuthering Heights it always sounded on
quiet days, following a great thaw, or a
season of steady rain—and, of VVuthering
Heights, Catherine was thinking as she lis-
tened; that is, if she thought, or listened, at
all; but she had the vague, distant look, I
mentioned before, which expressed no recogni-
tion of material things either by ear or eye.

“ There’s a letter for you, Hrs. Linton,” I
said, gently inserting it in one hand that rested
on her -knee. “You must read it iimrnedi-
ately, because it wants an answer. Shall I
break the seal ?”

“ Yes,” she answered, without altering the
direction of her eyes. I

I opened it—it was very short.
