walk to the top of those hills? I wonder what
lies on the other side--is it the sea?"

"'No, Miss Cathy," I would answer, "it
is hills again just like these."

"And what are those golden rocks like, when
you stand under them?" she once asked.

The abrupt descent of Penistone Craggs
particularly attracted her notice, especially
when the setting sun shone on it, and the top-
most Heights; and the whole extent of land-
scape besides lay in shadow.

I explained that they were bare masses of
stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts
to nourish a stunted tree.

"And why are they bright so long after it
is evening here?" she pursued.

"Because they are a great deal higher up
than we are," replied I; "you could not climb
them, they are too high and steep. In winter
the frost is always there before it comes to us;
and, deep into summer, I have found snow
under that black hollow on the north-east
side!"
