lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness.
I've taught him to scorn everything, extra-ani-
mal, as silly and weak--Don't you think Hind-
ley would be proud of his son, if he could see
him? almost as proud as I am of mine--But
there's this difference, one is gold put to the
use of paving stones; and the other is tin po-
lished to ape a service of silver--Mine has
nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have
the merit, of making it go as far as such poor
stuff can go. His had first-rate qualities, and
they are lost--rendered worse than unavailing
--I have nothing to regret; he would have
more than any, but I, are aware of--And the
best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me!
You'll own that I've out-matched Hindley there
--If the dead villain could rise from his grave to
abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have
the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him back
again, indignant that he should dare to rail at
the one friend he has in the world!"
