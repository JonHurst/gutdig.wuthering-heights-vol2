would return; before she did see him again,
his features had Waxed so dim in her memory
that she did not recognise him.

VVhen I chanced to encounter the house-
keeper of Wuthering Heights, in paying busi-
ness-visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how
the young master got on; for he lived almost
as secluded as Catherine herself, and was never
to be seen. I could gather from her that he
continued in weak health, and was a tiresome
inmate. She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to
dislike him ever longer and worse, though he
took some trouble to conceal it. He hacl an
antiiathy to the sound of his voice, and could
not do at all with his sitting in the same room
with him many minutes together.

There seldom passed much talk between
them; Linton learnt his lessons, and spent his
evenings in a small apartment, they called the
parlour; or else lay in bed all day; for he
was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and

aches, and pains of some sort.
