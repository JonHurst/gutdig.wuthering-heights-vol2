4 WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

the touching interest, which she wakened, and
invariably to me, 1 know, and to any person
who saw her, I should think, refuted more tan-
gible proofs of convalescence and stamped her
as one doomed to decay.

A book lay spread on the sill before her, and
the scarcely perceptible Wind ï¬‚uttered its
leaves at intervals. I believe Linton had
laid it there, for she never endeavoured to
divert herself with reading, or occupation of
any kind; and he would spend many an hour
in trying to entice her attention to some sub-
ject which had formerly been her amusement.

She was conscious of his aim, and in her
better moods, endured his efforts placidly; only
showing their uselessness by now and then
suppressing a wearied sigh, and cheeking him
at last, with the saddest of smiles and kisses.
At other times, she would turn petulantly
away, and hide her face in her hands, or even
push him off angrily; and then he took care
to let her alone, for he was certain of doing

no good.
