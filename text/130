my descendent fairly lord of their estates; my
child hiring their children, to till their fathers'
lands for wages--That is the sole considera-
tion which can make me endure the whelp--
I despise him for himself, and hate him for
the memories he revives! But, that conside-
ration is sufficient; he's as safe with me, and
shall be tended as carefully, as your master
tends his own-I have a room upstairs, fur-
nished For him, in handsome style--I've en-
gaged a tutor, also, to come three times a
week, from twenty miles distance, to teach
him what he pleases to learn. I've ordered
Hareton to obey him: and in fact, I've ar-
ranged every thing with a view to preserve
the superior, and the gentleman in him, above
his associates I do regret however, that he
so little deserves the trouble--if I wished any
blessing in the world, it was to find him a
worthy object of pride, and I'm bitterly dis-
appointed with the whey-faced whining
wretch!"
