WUTHERING nnrtcurs. 175

“Ellen! you’ll have to fetch the key, or
else I must run round to the porter’s lodge.
I_can’t scale the ramparts on this side!"

“ Stay where you are,” I answered, “ I have
my bundle of keys in my pocket; perhaps I
may manage to open it, if not, I’ll go.”

Catherine amused herself’ with dancing to
and fro before the door, While I tried all the
large keys in succession. I had applied the
last, and found that none would do; so, re-
peating my desire that she would remain
there, I was about to hurry home as fast as I
could, when an approaching sound arrested me.
It was the trot of a horse; Cathy’s dance
stopped; and in a minute the horse stopped
also.

“ ‘W ho is that?” I whispered.

“ Ellen,] wish you could open the door,”
whispered back my companion. anxiously.

“ Ho, Miss Linton I” cried a deep voice,
(the rider’s.) “ I’m glad to meet you. Don’t
be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation

to ask and obtain.”
