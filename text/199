WUTHERING HEIGHTS. 191

“I wish she felt as I do," he replied,
“ spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton never touches
me, he never struck me in his life—And I was

a whimper.

“I didn’t strike you!” muttered Cathy
chewing her lip to prevent another burst of
emotion.

He sighed and moaned like one under
great suff'ering; and kept it up for a quarter
of an hour, on purpose to distress his cousin,
apparently, for whenever he caught a stifled
sob from her, he put renewed pain and pathos
into the inﬂexions of his voice.

" I’m sorry I hurt you, Linton !” she said
at length, racked beyond endurance. “But I
couldn't have been hurt by that little push;
and I had no idea that you could, either—-
you’re not much, are you, Linton? Don’t let
me go home, thinking I’ve done you harm!

answer, speak to me.”
