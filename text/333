CHAPTER XVII.

YESTERDAY was bright, calm, and frosty. I
went to the Heights as I proposed; my house-
keeper entreated me to bear a little note from
her to her young lady, and I did not refuse,
for the worthy woman was not conscious of
anything odd in her request.

The front door stood open, but the jealous
gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked
and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden
beds; he unchained it, and I entered. The
fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.
