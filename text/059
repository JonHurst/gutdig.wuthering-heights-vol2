WUTEIERING HEIGHTS. 51

“ He’s there...is he ?” xclairned my compa-
nion, rushing to the gap. “ If I can get my
arm out I can hit him!”

“ I’m afraid Ellen, you’ll set me down, as
really wicked—but you don’t know all, so don’t
judge! I wouldn't have aided or abetted an
attempt on even his life, for anything—Wish
that he were dead, I must; and therefore, I
was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by

weapon and wrenched it from his grasp.

The charge exploded, and the knife, in
springing back, closed into its 0wne1"s wrist.
Heatheliff pulled it away by main force, slitting
up the ﬂesh as it passed on, and thrust it drip-
ping into his pocket. He then took a stone,
struck down the division between two windows
and sprung in. His adversary had fallen
se'nseless with excessive pain, and the ﬂow of

blood that gushed from an artery, ora large

vein.
