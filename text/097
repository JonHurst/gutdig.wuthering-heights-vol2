will be dark in ten minutes. \Vhere is the
pony, Miss Cathy? And where is Phenix? I
shall leave you, unless you _be quick, so please
yourself.”

“The pony is in the yard,” she replied,
“ and Phenix is shut in there. He’s bitten-
and so is Charlie. I was going to tell you all
about it; but you are in a bad temper, and
don’t deserve to hear.”

I picked up her hat, and approached to re-
instate it; but perceiving that the people of
the house took her part, she commenced ca-
pering roundthe room; and, on my giving
chase, ran like a mouse, over and under, and
behind the furniture, rendering it ridiculous

for me to pursue.

Hareton and the woman laughed; and she
joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;
till I cried, in great irritation.

“VVell, Miss Cathy, if you were aware
whose house this is, you’d be glad enough to

get out.”
