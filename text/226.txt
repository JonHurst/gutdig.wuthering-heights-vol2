218 WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

“ I ran into the yard, sick withterror; and
called for Zillah, as loud as I could. She
soon heard me; she was milking the cows in
a shed behind the barn; and hurrying from
her Work, she inquired what there was to do?

“I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her
in, I looked about for Linton, Earnshaw had
come out to examine the mischief he had caus-
ed, and he was then conveying the poor thing
up-stairs. Zillah and I ascended after him;
but, he stopped me, at the top of the steps,
and said, I shouldn’t go in, I must go home.

“I exclaimed that he had killed Linton and I
would enter.

“Joseph locked the door, and declared I
should do ‘no sich stuff,’ and asked me whe-
ther I were ‘ balm to be as mad as him.’

“ I stood crying, till the housekeeper re-ap-
pcared; she aﬂirmed he would be better in a
bit; but he couldn't do with that shrieking,
and din, and she took me, and nearly carried

me into the house.
