342 WUTHERING HEIGHTS-.

——too warm for travelling; but the heat did
not hinder me from enjoying the delightful
scenery above and below; had I seen it nearer
August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to
waste a month among its solitudes. In Winter,
nothing more dreary, in summer, nothing
more divine, than those glens shut in by hills,
and those bluff, bold swells of heath.

I reached the Grange before sunset, and
knocked for admittance; but the family had re-
treated into the back premises, I judged by one
thin, blue wreath curling from the kitchen
chimney, and they did not hear.

I rode into the court. Under the porch, a
girl of nine or ten, sat knitting, and an old
woman reclined on the horse-steps, smoking a
meditative pipe.

“ Is Mrs. Dean within ?” I demanded of the
dame.

“ Mistress’ Dean ? Nay !” she answered,

“shoo doesn’t bide here; shoo’s up at th’
Heights.”
