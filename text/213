thing, and reappeared, presently, leading
Miss's pony; and there she was, just dis-
mounted, and walking by its side.

The man took his charge stealthily across
the grass towards the stable. Cathy entered
by the casement-window of the drawing-room,
and glided noiselessly up to where I awaited
her.

She put the door gently to, slipped off her
snowy shoes, untied her hat, and was proceed-
ing, unconscious of my espionage, to lay aside
her mantle, when I suddenly rose, and revealed
myself. The surprise petrified her an instant:
she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and
stood fixed.

"My dear Miss Catherine," I began, too
vividly impressed by her recent kindness to
break into a scold, "where have you been
riding out at this hour? And why should you
try to deceive me, by telling a tale. Where
have you been? Speak!"
