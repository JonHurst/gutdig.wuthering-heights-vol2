head-stones on the slope next the moor--the
middle one, grey, and half buried in heath-
Edgar Linton's only harmonized by the turf,
and moss creeping up its foot--Heathcliff's
still bare.

I lingered round them, under that benign
sky; watched the moths fluttering among the
heath, and hare-bells; listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass; and wondered
how any one could ever imagine unquiet slum-
bers, for the sleepers in that quiet earth.

THE END.
