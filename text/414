and probably hardly had a Bible in your
hands, during all that period. You must have
forgotten the contents of the book, and you
may not have space to search it now. Could
it be hurtful to send for some one--some min-

he said, for you remind me of the manner that
I desire to be buried in--It is to be carried to

and mind, particularly, to notice that the sex-
ton obeys my directions concerning the two
coffins! No minister need come; nor need
anything be said over me--I tell you, I have
nearly attained my heaven; and that of others
is altogether unvalued, and uncoveted by me!"
