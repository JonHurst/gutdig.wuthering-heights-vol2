ed—I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that
I—that I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by
me Catherine; give me your hand.”

“Take mine,” said his father, “ stand on
your feet! There now—-she’ll lend you her
arm...that’s right, look at her. You Would

to excite such horror. Be so kind as to wall:
home with him, will you? He shudders, if I

touch him.”
