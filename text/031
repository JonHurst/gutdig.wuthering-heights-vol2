beautiful than she appeared; and I partook of
the infinite calm in which she lay. My mind
was never in a holier frame, than while I gazed
on that untroubled image of Divine rest. I in-
stinctively echoed the words she had uttered,
a few hours before. "Incomparably beyond,
and above us all! Whether still on earth or
now in Heaven her spirit is at home with
God!"

I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me,
but I am seldom otherwise than happy while
watching in the chamber of death, should no
frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty
with me. I see a repose that neither earth nor
hell can break; and I feel an assurance of
the endless and shadowless hereafter--the
Eternity they have entered--where life is
boundless in its duration, and love in its sym-
pathy, and joy in its fulness. I noticed on
that occasion how much selfishness there is
even in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so
regretted Catherine's blessed release!
