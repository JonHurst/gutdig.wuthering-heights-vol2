Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this
neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus en-
listed my informant among her enemies, as se-
curely as if she had done her some great
wrong.

I had a. long talk with Zillah, about six
weeks ago, a little before you came, one day,
when we foregathered on the moor; and this
is what she told me.

“ The ﬁrst thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said,
“ on her arrival-at the Heights, was to run up-
stairs without even wishing good-evening to
me and Joseph ; she shut herself into Linton’s
room, and remained till morning—then, while
the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast,
she entered the house and asked all in a quiver

if the doctor might be sent for? her cousin was

very ill.”
