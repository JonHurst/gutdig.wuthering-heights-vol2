WUTHERING HEIGHTS. 413

at the turn of the Heights, I encountered a
little boy with a sheep, and two lambs before
him, he was crying terribly, and I supposed
the lambs Were skittish, and would not be
guided.

“‘\Vhat is the matter, my little man?’ I
asked.

“ ‘ They’s Heathcliff, and a woman, yonder,
under t’ Nab,’ he blubbered, ‘ un’ Aw darnut
pass ’em.’

“I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor
he would go on, so I bid him take the road
lower down.

“He probably raised the phantoms from
thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on
the nonsense he had heard his parents and
companions repeat—yet still, I don’t like being
out in the dark, noW—and I don’t like being
left by myself in this grim house—I cannot
help it, I shall be glad when they leave it, and
shift to the Grange!”
