"but I do want to see him; and he hasn't
once looked out."

The carriage stopped; and the sleeper,
being roused, was lifted to the ground by his
uncle.

"This is your cousin Cathy, Linton," he
said, putting their little hands together.
"She's fond of you already; and mind you
don't grieve her by crying to-night. Try to be
cheerful now; the travelling is at an end, and
you have nothing to do but rest and amuse
yourself as you please."

"Let me go to bed then," answered the
boy, shrinking from Catherine's salute; and
he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipi~
ent tears.

"Come, come, there's a good child," I whis-
pered, leading him in. "You'll make her weep
too--see how sorry she is for you I"

I do not know whether it were sorrow for
him, but his cousin put on as sad a counte-
nance as himself, and returned to her father.
