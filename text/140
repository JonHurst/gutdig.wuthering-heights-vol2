132 WUTHERING HEIGHTS.

“\Vell,” said I, “where are your moor-
game, Miss Cathy? VVe should be at them——-
the Grange park-fence is a great way off
now.”

“ Oh, a little furthcr—only a. little further,
Ellen,” was her answer, continually. “ Climb
to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time
you reach the other side, I shall have raised
the birds.”

But there were so many hilloclcs and banks
to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be
weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace
our steps. I

I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me,
a long way; she either did not hear, or did not
regard, for she still sprang on, and I was com-
pelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a.
hollow; and before I came in sight of her
again, she was two miles nearer VVuthering
Heights than her own home; and I behold a
couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I

felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.
