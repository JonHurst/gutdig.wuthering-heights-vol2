"Well," said I, "where are your moor-
game, Miss Cathy? We should be at them--
the Grange park-fence is a great way off
now."

"Oh, a little further--only a little further,
Ellen," was her answer, continually. "Climb
to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time
you reach the other side, I shall have raised
the birds."

But there were so many hillocks and banks
to climb and pass, that, at length, I began to be
weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace
our steps.

I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me,
a long way; she either did not hear, or did not
regard, for she still sprang on, and I was com-
pelled to follow. Finally, she dived into a
hollow; and before I came in sight of her
again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering
Heights than her own home; and I behold a
couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I
felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.
