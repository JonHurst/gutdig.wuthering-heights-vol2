bearing a basin of milk-porridge, and placed

his master's scorn of the child, though he was

"Cannot ate it?" repeated he, peering in
Linton's face, and subduing his voice to a
whisper, for fear of being overheard. "But
Maister Hareton nivir ate nowt else, when he
wer a little un: und what wer gooid enough
fur him's gooid eneugh fur yah, Aw's rayther

"I shan't eat it!" answered Linton, snap-

Joseph snatched up the food indignantly, and
brought it to us.
