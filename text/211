got forward steadily about an hour; then came
frequent questions.

"Ellen, are not you tired? Hadn't you
better lie down now? You'll be sick, keeping
up so long, Ellen."

"No, no, dear, I'm not tired," I returned,
continually.

Perceiving me immovable, she essayed an-
other method of showing her dis-relish for her
occupation. It changed to yawning, and
stretching, and-

"Ellen, I'm tired."

"Give over then and talk," I answered.

That was worse; she fretted and sighed, and
looked at her watch till eight; and finally
went to her room, completely overdone with
sleep, judging by her peevish, heavy look, and
the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes.

The following night she seemed more impa-
tient still; and on the third from recovering
my company, she complained of a head-ache,
and left me.
