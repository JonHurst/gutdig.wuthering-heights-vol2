“that his son shall come to lVuthering
Heights to-morrow. He is in bed, and too
tired to go the distance now. You may also
tell him that the mother of Linton desired him
to remain under my guardianship; and, at
present, his health is very precarious.”

his prop on the ﬂoor, and assuming an authori-
tative air. “ Noa! that manes noWt—Hathe-
cliff maks noa ’cahnt uh t’ mother, nur yah
norther—bud he'll hev his lad; und Aw mun

tak l1im—soa nah yah knaw I”
