let us exchange a few words, in your pre-
sence! we have done nothing to deserve this
separation; and you are not angry with me-
you have no reason to dislike me--you allow
yourself'. Dear uncle! send me a kind note
to-morrow; and leave to join you anywhere
you please, except at Thrushcross Grange. I
believe an interview would convince you that
my father's character is not mine; he affirms
I am more your nephew than his son; and
though I have faults which render me un-
worthy of Catherine, she has excused them,
and, for her sake, you should also. You inquire
after my health--it is better; but while I re-
main cut off from all hope, and doomed to soli-
tude, or the society of those who never did,
and never will like me, how can I be cheerful
and well?"

Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not
consent to grant his request; because he could
not accompany Catherine.
