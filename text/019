and eating deeper eternally, after you have left
me? You know you lie to say I have killed
you; and, Catherine, you know that I could
as soon forget you, as my existence! Is it not
sufficient for your infernal selfishness, that
while you are at peace I shall writhe in the
torments of hell?"

"I shall not be at peace," moaned Catherine,
recalled to a sense of physical Weakness by the
violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which
beat visibly, and audibly under this excess of
agitation.

She said nothing further till the paroxysm
was over; then she continued, more kindly--

"I'm not Wishing you greater torment than
I have, Heathcliff! I only wish us never to be
parted--and should a word of mine distress
you hereafter, think I feel the same distress
underground, and for my own sake, forgive
me! Come here and kneel down again! You
never harmed me in your life. Nay, if you
nurse anger, that will be worse to remember
