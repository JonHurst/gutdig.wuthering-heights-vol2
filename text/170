162 w UTHERING HEIGHTS.

Never did any bird ﬂying back toaplundered
nest which it had left brim-ful of chirping
young ones, express more complete despair in
its anguished cries, and ﬂutterings, than she
by her single “ Oh!” And the change that
transﬁgured her late happy countenance. Mr.
Linton looked up.

“VVhat is the matter, love? Have you
hurt yourself ?” he said.

His tone and look, assured her he had not
been the discoverer of the board.

“ N o papa—” she gasped. “ Ellen ! Ellen!
come up-stairs-I’m sick!”

I obeyed her summons, and accompanied her
out.

“Oh, Ellen! you have got them,” she com-
menced immediately, dropping on her knees,
when We were enclosed alone. “ 0, give them
to me, and I’ll never never do so again ! Don’t
tell papa—You have not told papa, Ellen, say
you have not! I’ve been exceedingly naughty,

but I Won’t do it any more 1"
