says I'm not to be soft with Catherine--she's
my Wife, and it's shameful that she should
wish to leave me I He says, she hates me, and
wants me to die, that she may have my money,
but she shan't have it; and she shan't go
home! she never shall! she may cry, and be
sick as much as she pleases!"

"Master Heathcliff," I resumed, "have
you forgotten all Catherine's kindness to you,
last Winter, when you affirmed you loved her,
and when she brought you books, and sung
you songs, and came many a time through
Wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss
one evening, because you would be disap-
pointed; and you felt then, that she was a
hundred times too good to you; and now you
believe the lies your father tells, though you
know he detests you both! And you join
him against her. That's fine gratitude, is it
not?"
