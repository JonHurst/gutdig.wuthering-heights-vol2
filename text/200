"you've hurt me so, that I shall lie awake all
night, choking with this cough! If you had it
you'd know what it was--but you'll be com-
fortably asleep, while I'm in agony--and nobo-
dy near me! I wonder how you would like to
pass those fearful nights!" And he began to

dreadful nights," I said, "it wont be Miss
who spoils your ease; you'd be the same, had
she never come--However, she shall not dis-
turb you, again--and perhaps, you'll get
quieter when We leave you."

"Must I go?" asked Catherine dolefully,
bending over him. "Do you want me to go,
Linton?"

"You can't alter what you've done?" he
replied pettishly, shrinking from her, "unless
you alter it for the worse, by teasing me into
a fever!"
