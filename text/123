"and it is not quite so large, but you can see
the country beautifully, all round; and the air

next best in the neighbourhood. And you
will have such nice rambles on the moors!
Hareton Earnshaw--that is Miss Cathy's other
cousin; and so yours in a manner--will show
you all the sweetest spots; and you can bring
a book in fine weather, and make a green hol-
low your study; and, now and then, your un-
cle may join you in a walk; he does, fre-
quently, walk out on the hills."
