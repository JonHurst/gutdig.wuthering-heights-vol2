“ But why have I not heard of him before?”
asked Linton; “ why didn’t mamma, and he
live together as other people do?”

“ He had business to keep him in the
north,” I answered; “ and your mother's health
required her to reside in the south.”

“ And why didn’t mamma speak to me
about him?” persevered the child. “ She
often talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him
long ago. How am I to love papa? I don’t
know him.”

“ Oh, all children love their parents,” I
said. “ Your mother, perhaps, thought you
would want to be with him, if she mentioned
him often to you. -Let us make haste. An
early ride on such a beautiful morning is much
preferable to an hour's more sleep.”

“ Is she to go with us,” he demanded. “ The
little girl I saw yesterday?”

“Not now,” replied I.

“ Is uncle?” he continued.
