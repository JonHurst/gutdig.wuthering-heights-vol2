CHAPTER XVIII.

l802.——This September, I was invited to de-
vastate the moors of a friend, in the North;
and, on my journey to his abode, I unexpect-_
edly came within ﬁfteen miles of Gimmerton.
The hostler, at a roadside public-house, was
holding a pail of water to refresh my horses,
when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped,
passed by, and he remarked-

“ Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah!‘ They’re

allas three wick’ after other folk wi’ ther har-

vest.”
