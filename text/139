“ No, it’s not,” she said. “ I've gone very

I put on my bonnet, and sallied out;
thinking nothing more of the matter. She
bounded before me, and returned to my side,
and was of? again like a young greyhound;
and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment
in listening to the larks singing far and near;
and enjoying the sweet, warm sunshine; and
watching her, my pet, and my delight, with
her golden ringlets ﬂying loose behind, and her
bright cheek, as soft and pure in its bloom,
as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with
cloudless pleasure. She was a happy creature,
and an angel, in those days. It’s a pity she

could not be content.
