haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their
murderers. I believe--I know that ghosts
have wandered on earth. Be with me always
--take any form--drive me mad! only do not
leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you!
Oh, God! it is unutterable! I cannot live
without my life! I cannot live without my
soul!"

trunk; and, lifting up his eyes, howled, not

the bark of the tree, and his hand and fore-
head were both stained; probably the scene I
witnessed was a repetition of others acted dur-
ing the night. It hardly moved my compassion
--it appalled me; still I felt reluctant to quit
him so. But the moment he recollected him-
self enough to notice me watching, he thun-
dered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.
He was beyond my skill to quiet or console!
