more trouble--Necessity compelled me to seek
shelter here; though if I had not learnt he
was out of the way, I'd have halted at the
kitchen, Washed my face, warmed myself, got
you to bring what I wanted, and departed
again to anywhere out of the reach of my ac-
eursed--of that incarnate goblin! Ah, he
was in such a fury--if he had caught me! It's
a pity, Earnshaw is not his match in strength
--I wouldn't have run, till I'd seen him all but
demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!"

"Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!" I inter-
rupted, "you'll disorder the handkerchief I
have tied round your face, and make the cut
bleed again--Drink your tea, and take breath
and give over laughing--Laughter is sadly
out of place under this roof, and in your con-
dition!"

"An undeniable truth,"she replied, "Listen
to that child! It maintains a constant wail-
send it out of my hearing, for an hour; I
shan't stay any longer."
